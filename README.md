------------------------------

### Prerequisites 

Pre-reqs: At least one graduate course completed in Data Mining/Machine Learning. Online courses do not count. 

------------------------------

### Scope

This is an advanced, seminar-oriented course. We shall study recently published papers relevant to the development of responsible and trustworthy data driven automated decision systems. Solid background in pattern recognition/machine learning is assumed. Key topics include building explainable ML models, explanations of decisions made by ML models, interpretation of “black-box” behavior, algorithmic fairness, robustness of solutions specially  in response to data/problem  drift.  Coursework will mainly involve paper presentations, critiques and discussion, a mini coding-based project and a major term project on developing some aspects of a responsible ML system.

### Schedule and Format

(assuming a class of 24 students).

The latest schedule is shared as a spreadsheet via Canvas.

- Overview		2 classes
- Explainability	 (P)	10-12 classes
- Fairness (P)		5-6 classes
- Assurance (P)		5-6 classes
- Guest Speakers	1-4 classes
- Project talks		3 classes (late Nov)

Topics marked by (P) are student-led presentations, done in groups of 2.
